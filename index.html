                  Call of Duty: Black Ops is by far my favourite entry in the series. It was the third entry in the series that I had played. It came out in November of 2010 and helped destroy my GPA. The game was much more slower paced when compared to previous entries. I loved the slow, clunky movement and how it led to a more methodical playstyle. I absolutely loathed the netcode within the game. The absolute best part of this game was playing with friends until 3 AM.

               <h2 class = 'center'>Civilization V</h2>
               <p>
                  Civilization V is a game that I had discovered while in university by chance. I had no prior experience with the series. I remember loading up the first game and being greatly overwhelmed by everything. I quickly realized that this game was incredibly addicting! I would start playing at noon and wouldn't stop until 8 PM later that night, I would forget about eating and drinking. Obviously, the downside being that a single game took <b>FOREVER</b>. Sadly, now I can't even start a game, let alone finish one.

               <p>
                  My best friend introduced me to this game, it has a special place in my heart. Growing up what I wanted more than anything, was more video games. My parents did not indulge my video game addiction. They did, however, buy me this game. As I didn't have access to other <b>new</b> games, I would replay this many times. At the time, I wasn't aware of speed running video games, however, I was unintentionally doing so in subsequent playthroughs of the game. I never did get the best weapons in the game, i.e. Skorm's Bow.

               <h2 class = 'center'>Pokémon Sapphire</h2>
               <p>
                  I had played the previous entries within the Pokémon series, however, this entry in particular had absolutely blown me away. The first thing that wowed me were the graphics, even though pixel images were still being used, the game looked so <b>AMAZING!</b> I remember being amazed that you could run in the game, you couldn't in the previous entries. The added running feature made traversing the game so much easier! It took me a while to figure it out but this game introduced the physical/ special attack split. The split made it so that different Pokémon used attack or special attack when calculating damage. Sadly I never caught them all, without the game transfer system it was very difficult to complete a Pokédex.

               <p>
                  Prior to this game, I had never played an online game before. At first glance, I remember not being very interested in the game, this was primarily because of the point and click nature of the game. However, I loved the complexity of the game and being able to play with friends while we were not in the same house. I remember not having any idea what I was doing, this made the game more fun as I would constantly learn more about the game. Now, I could not play the game, this is primarily because the game has a wiki and that takes away any mystery from the game.
